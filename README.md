# delemr

<!-- badges: start -->

This package contains a collection of functions that I have developed
for various purposes in my work. The functions are not necessarily
related to each other, but they all have been useful to me at some
point.

If one of those has caught your attention for some reason, you can install delemr like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("m-delem/delemr")
```
