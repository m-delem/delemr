This package contains several functions that I have developed for various 
purposes in my work. These functions are not necessarily related to each other, 
they only have in common that they have been useful to me at some point. 

*(The package logo and website were just for fun* :eyes: *- and learning how to 
create them.)*

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-delem/delemr")
```
