This package several functions that I have developed for various purposes in my 
work. These functions are not necessarily related to each other, they only have 
in common that they have been useful to me at some point. 

If one of those caught your eye, you can install `delemr` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-delem/delemr")
```

*(The package logo and website were just for fun* :eyes: *- and learning how to create them.)*
